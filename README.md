# Machine Learning Crash Course

<b>Short Link to repo</b> - [bit.ly/amity_mlcc](https://github.com/Praneet460/MLCC)

This repository is created to teach students <i>how to build</i> Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects using TensorFlow.

### Some machine learning and deep learning projects to understand the core concepts

- <b>IntoToTF-Part1: </b>General introduction to tensors in TensorFlow and how can we perform the common mathematical operations with them.
- <b>IntoToTF-Part2: </b>See how we can perform the large matrix operations with tensors and know about some commonly used methods in matrix operations.
- <b>IntoToTF-Part3: </b>Make your own first perceptron and apply different activation functions to it.
- <b>IntroToTF-Part4: </b>See some more commonly performed methods while training deep neural network.
- <b>IntoToTF-Eager Execution: </b>More pythonic way of working with tensorflow api
- <b>IntroToTF-Autograd: </b>How to perform automatic differentiation
- <b>IntoToTF-SimpleLinearRegression: </b>Create a simple linear regression model with only one dependent and independent variable.
- <b>IntroToTF-MultiVariateRegression: </b>Predict the fuel efficiency on Auto-MPG dataset.

### How to get started?
- <b>Fork</b> the repo on GitHub
- <b>Clone</b> the project to your own machine

### How to run Jupyter Notebook?
To run this notebook you need to <b>install necessary packages</b>, listed down. If you have not done so, you will need to install them first, as these are not in the Anaconda distribution as of now. From a command prompt on your computer type the following command. If no error occurs, you will have installed them.

```pip install numpy```  ```pip install pandas``` ```pip install matplotlib``` ```pip install seaborn``` ```pip install tensorflow``` 


### Pre-requisite
A bit of experience with Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook is sufficient. If you are a beginner in python then you can follow along with:
