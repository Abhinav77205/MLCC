    "<b>Eager Execution</b> is an experimental interface to TensorFlow that provides an imperative programming style. When you enable ```Eager execution```, TensorFlow operations execute immediately as they are called from Python. That means you do not execute a pre-constructed graph with ```Session.run()```. This allows for fast debugging and a more intuitive way to get started with TensorFlow."
